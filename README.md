Agentic Software Company: MVP
This project is an Agentic Software Company MVP, a prototype of an autonomous software development team powered by a hierarchy of AI agents. The system takes user requests and automatically manages the entire software development lifecycle, from initial triage and resource allocation to task execution and quality assurance.

ðŸŽ¯ Core Functionality
Our MVP demonstrates the potential of an agent-based system to streamline and automate software development.

Client Agent: Serves as the first point of contact, accepting user requests via a simple web form or chat. It performs an initial triage to classify the request's complexity and forwards it to the CEO Agent.

CEO Agent: Acts as the strategic leader, prioritizing requests based on business impact and assigning them to the Product Manager Agent.

Product Manager Agent: Decomposes complex requests into smaller, manageable tasks (epics or user stories) and coordinates with the HR Agent for resource planning.

HR Agent: Analyzes the complexity of tasks and recommends the optimal number and type of execution-level sub-agents (e.g., Developers, Testers) needed to complete the work.

Project Manager Agent: Manages the workflow, assigning tasks to the instantiated sub-agents and monitoring their progress to prevent bottlenecks.

Lead Agent: Ensures quality by reviewing all outputs (e.g., code, test cases) for compliance with predefined standards. It routes any issues back to the relevant sub-agents for revision.

Dynamic Staffing: The system can dynamically instantiate and scale the team of sub-agents based on the HR Agent's recommendations, ensuring efficient resource allocation.

Dashboard Visualization: Provides a real-time view of the entire process, including task progress, agent utilization heatmaps, and Gantt charts for project timelines.

ðŸš€ How It Works: A Demo Scenario
Request Submission: A stakeholder submits a request via the web form: "Build a secure login page with OAuth and analytics."

Triage & Prioritization: The Client Agent triages the request as "medium complexity." The CEO Agent receives it, assigns a high priority, and forwards it to the Product Manager Agent.

Task Decomposition & Staffing: The Product Manager Agent breaks the request down into subtasks (UI, backend, analytics, testing) and requests a team from the HR Agent. The HR Agent analyzes the keywords ("OAuth," "analytics") and recommends a team of "2 Developers, 1 Analyst, 1 Tester."

Execution: The Project Manager Agent instantiates the recommended sub-agents and assigns tasks.

Quality Assurance: As the sub-agents complete their tasks, the Lead Agent reviews their output. It detects a bug in the OAuth implementation and routes the revision request back to the relevant Developer Agent.

Completion: The developer fixes the bug, the code passes the quality checks, and the Client Agent notifies the stakeholder of the successful completion.

âœ¨ Features & Stakeholder Value
Feature	MVP Implementation Example	Stakeholder Value
Web/Chat Intake	Client Agent receives and triages requests.	Provides a simple, familiar way to submit requests.
Task Assignment	CEO and Product Manager Agents assign and delegate tasks.	Ensures transparency and a clear chain of command.
Dashboard Visualization	Progress bars, Gantt charts, agent utilization heatmaps.	Offers real-time oversight and confidence in the process.
Code Review Loop	Lead Agent flags issues and routes revisions.	Guarantees high-quality, iterative improvement of outputs.
Dynamic Staffing	HR Agent recommends 1-6 sub-agents based on complexity.	Ensures efficient scaling and optimizes resource allocation.
Human-in-the-Loop	Manual override for HR recommendations or agent pauses.	Allows for manual control and security during critical stages.
